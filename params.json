Just ``Paper.clear()``\r\n  * Arrowed.remove() => Removes the paper/stage from the DOM.  Just ``Paper.remove()``\r\n\r\n## What you can set in options:\r\n### Arrowed.init stage-options:\r\n  * A mix of [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Raphael) init things AND few custom things\r\n  * debugger: true/false => Defaults to false and enables the console.logs & a stroke on the edge of the stage/paper\r\n\r\n### Arrowed.init arrow-options:\r\n  * [An object of arrow initializations](http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.attr)\r\n  * The default will be...\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  {\r\n\t\tstroke: 'rgb(57, 180, 213)' / blue\r\n\t\t'stroke-width': 6\r\n\t\t'stroke-linecap': 'round'\r\n\t\t'arrow-end': 'open-wide-midium'\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Arrowed.draw options:\r\n  * curveOutlier: {x:###, y:###} => tell the arrow where the outlier is\r\n  * curveOutlierBend: [positive, negative] => this is ignored if an outlier is given.\r\n  * sourceStart: [top, right, bottom, left, center] [right, left, center]\r\n  * targetEnd: [top, right, bottom, left, center] [top, right, bottom, left, center]\r\n\r\n## V1 does not:\r\n  * erase allows individually.  You must wipe the one and only stage/paper.\r\n  * animate...anything.\r\n","google":"UA-8689104-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
